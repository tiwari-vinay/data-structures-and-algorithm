Note for a string of string of length n with only one character : number of palindromic substring possible is n*(n+1)/2

1. Largest palindromic substring
2. Substring of one string in another string (best solution is of O(n^2))
3. Count of k-size substring having palindromic permutations
4. Count of all substrings having all distinct characters
5. Maximize partition such that no two substring has common character
6. Given a string S of length N and integer K, find the smallest length string which contains the string S as a sub string exactly K times.
7. Given a string S, the task is to check if S contains a pair of substrings of length K which are anagrams of each other and doesnâ€™t contain the character X in them. If no such substring exists, print -1.
8. Largest substring to be removed to make a string palindrome
9. Given a string str and an integer K, the task is to find the length of the longest sub-string S such that every character in S appears at least K times.
10. Pattern using suffix Trie
11. Print all the subsequence of all the string 
12.
